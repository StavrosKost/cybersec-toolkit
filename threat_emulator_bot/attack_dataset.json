//this file essentially has mitre attack from https://github.com/mitre-attack,
//you can download it from there, i could not paste it here because it was too big for a 1 line.
//Also since the framework only explains what each attack does and not how it is done with a cmd command you may leave it aside and you can just create a file with this name.
